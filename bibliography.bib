	abstract = {The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) Advanced Test Reactor (ATR), a DOE Category A reactor, was designed to provide an irradiation test environment for conducting a variety of experiments. The ATR Safety Analysis Report, determined by DOE to meet the requirements of 10 CFR 830, Subpart B, provides versatility in types of experiments that may be conducted. This paper addresses two general types of experiments in the ATR facility and how safety analyses for experiments are related to the ATR safety basis. One type of experiment is more routine and generally represents greater risks; therefore this type of experiment is addressed with more detail in the safety basis. This allows individual safety analyses for these experiments to be more routine and repetitive. The second type of experiment is less defined and is permitted under more general controls. Therefore, individual safety analyses for the second type of experiment tend to be more unique from experiment to experiment. Experiments are also discussed relative to "major modifications" and DOE-STD-1027-92. Application of the USQ process to ATR experiments is also discussed.},

On the other hand, in CFD research aims to extend the boundaries of practical engineering use in “non-traditional” areas. Requirements of computational flexibility and code integration are contradictory: a change of coding paradigm, with object orientation, library components, equation mimicking is proposed as a way forward. This paper describes OpenFOAM, a C++ object oriented library for Computational Continuum Mechanics (CCM) developed by the author. Efficient and flexible implementation of complex physical models is achieved by mimicking the form of partial differential equation in software, with code functionality provided in library form. Open Source deployment and development model allows the user to achieve desired versatility in physical modeling without the sacrifice of complex geometry support and execution efficiency.},

The reactor core is modeled based on the reactor technical design specifications, and the fission products inventory is calculated by using the SCALE/TRITON depletion sequence to perform burnup and decay analyses via coupling the NEWT 2-D transport lattice code to the ORIGEN-S fuel depletion code. Fifty radioisotopes contributed to the evaluation, resulting in a source term of 3.7\&\#x2009;\&\#xd7;\&\#x2009;10$^{\textrm{14}}$ Bq. Atmospheric dispersion was evaluated using the Gaussian plume model via the HOTSPOT code. The plume centerline total effective dose (TED) was found to exceed the IAEA limits for occupational exposure of 0.02\&\#x2009;Sv; the results showed that the maximum dose is 200\&\#x2009;Sv within 200\&\#x2009;m from the reactor, under all the weather stability classes, after which it starts to decrease with distance, reaching 0.1\&\#x2009;Sv at 1\&\#x2009;km from the reactor. The radiation dose plume centerlines continue to the exceed international basic safety standards annual limit of 1\&\#x2009;mSv for public exposure, up to 80\&\#x2009;km from the reactor.},

	abstract = {Forecasting shoreline evolution for sandy coasts is important for sustainable coastal management, given the present-day increasing anthropogenic pressures and a changing future climate. Here, we evaluate eight different time-series forecasting methods for predicting future shorelines derived from historic satellite-derived shorelines. Analyzing more than 37,000 transects around the globe, we find that traditional forecast methods altogether with some of the evaluated probabilistic Machine Learning (ML) time-series forecast algorithms, outperform Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) predictions for the majority of the sites. When forecasting seven years ahead, we find that these algorithms generate better predictions than OLS for 54\% of the transect sites, producing forecasts with, on average, 29\% smaller Mean Squared Error (MSE). Importantly, this advantage is shown to exist over all considered forecast horizons, i.e., from 1 up to 11 years. Although the ML algorithms do not produce significantly better predictions than traditional time-series forecast methods, some proved to be significantly more efficient in terms of computation time. We further provide insight in how these ML algorithms can be improved so that they can be expected to outperform not only OLS regression, but also the traditional time-series forecast methods. These forecasting algorithms can be used by coastal engineers, managers, and scientists to generate future shoreline prediction at a global level and derive conclusions thereof.},

	title = {Surrogate modeling of advanced computer simulations using deep {Gaussian} processes},
	abstract = {The continuous advancements in computer power and computational modeling through high-ﬁdelity and multiphysics simulations add more challenges on assessing their predictive capability. In this work, metamodeling or surrogate modeling through deep Gaussian processes (DeepGP) is performed to construct surrogates of advanced computer simulations drawn from the nuclear engineering area. This work is centered around three major ideas: (1) surrogate modeling through deep Gaussian processes (DeepGP), (2) simulation assessment through surrogate-based uncertainty quantiﬁcation (UQ) methodologies, and (3) drawing conclusions regarding the underlying uncertainty of the four simulations considered in this paper. First, DeepGP models are trained, optimized, and validated to yield variety of features: (1) achieving high accuracy (small error metrics) on the validation set, (2) automatically capturing the surrogate model uncertainty (i.e. interpolation errors), (3) ﬁtting multiple outputs with diﬀerent scales simultaneously, (4) handling high dimensional input spaces, and (5) learning from small data amounts. Second, the validated DeepGP surrogates are utilized to eﬃciently perform UQ tasks such as uncertainty propagation (through Monte Carlo sampling), parameter screening (through Morris screening), and variance decomposition (through Sobol Indices) to investigate the selected simulations. Third, the thermal-hydraulics (ﬂuid ﬂow) results demonstrate the importance of inlet temperature uncertainty in void fraction predictions. For the reactor physics application (fuel depletion/consumption), DeepGP accurately captures the uncertainty in criticality calculations, which is about 0.6\% (i.e. a considerable value for this application). For the application of kinetic parameters (nuclear data), DeepGP successfully explains 95\% or more of the variance in all 12 outputs. Finally, DeepGP-based UQ analysis of the fuel performance application (materials science) shows the importance of the clad surface temperature, fuel porosity, and linear heat rate in explaining the variance of the maximum fuel centerline and surface temperatures.},

	abstract = {Implicit in any engineering design is an underlying optimization problem, although the exact objective function to be optimized is rarely stated explicitly. Nuclear systems optimization is as old as the discipline of nuclear engineering. Advanced manufacturing in the nuclear industry has opened the door for the re-examination of optimization in a way in which it was not possible before, namely, determining the optimal geometry for a given objective function. A trivial example is the sphere as the shape that minimizes the volume (or mass) of bare fissile material in a critical configuration. However, the problem becomes less trivial under even the simplest of multiphysics considerations. In this work, we develop the solution methodology for finding the minimum volume geometric configurations under the multiphysics constraints of 1,500 pcm excess reactivity and maximum fuel temperature of 618°C under forced-flow cooling conditions. Constraining the solution geometry only to right cylinders, surprisingly yields two disjoint solution regions. Flat, wide (disk-like) cylinders and tall, narrow (rod-like) cylinders both satisfy the constraints and yield very similar minimal volumes. However, the ultimate pursuit of this work is truly arbitrary geometry.},

	abstract = {A hybrid artificial neural network is used to model the thermodynamic behavior of the Tennessee Valley Authority's Sequoyah nuclear power plant using data for heat rate measurements acquired over a 1-yr pe-
riod. The modeling process involves the use of a self-organizing network to rearrange the original data into several classes by clustering. Then, the centroids of these clusters are used as the training patterns for an artificial neural network that utilizes
backpropagation training to adjust the weights on the connections between artificial neurons. This procedure greatly reduces the training time and reduces the system error. Comparison of the calculated heat rates with those predicted by the artificial neural network gives an error of
{\textless}0.1\%. A sensitivity analysis is then performed by taking the partial derivative of the heat rate with respect to each individual input to secure a sensitivity co-
efficient. These coefficients identified the input variables that were most important to improving the heat rate and efficiency. The methodology reported is an alternative to the conventional modeling procedures used in other heat rate monitoring systems. It has the advantage that the artificial neural network model is based on actual plant data that cover the dynamic range normally occurring over an annual cycle of operation, and it is not subject to linearization or empirical approximations. This process could be utilized by existing heat rate monitoring systems.},

In addition, systems are solved implicitly and fully coupled, employing physics-based preconditioning, which provides great flexibility even with large variance in time scales.

SVR models are regression analysis models using a kernel function for artificial neural networks. Their neural network weights are found by solving a quadratic programming problem under linear constraints. SVR models are trained using a training data set and then verified against another test data set. The proposed SVR models were applied to the first fuel cycle of the Yonggwang nuclear power plant unit 3. The root mean square errors of the SVR model, with and without in-core neutron flux sensor signal inputs, were 0.1113\% and 0.0968\%, respectively.

The objective of this effort was to create a more robust and reliable design, compared to the pre-2012 target. The team successfully completed this task to produce the DOE-IP cobalt (Co) production capsule design.

Three-interknited natural circulation loops are adopted by this PRHRS to remove the residual heat of the reactor core after a reactor trip. Based on the one-dimensional model and a simulation code (SCPRHRS), the transient behaviors of the PRHRS as well as the effects of the height difference between the steam generator and the heat exchanger and the heat transfer area of the heat exchanger are studied in detail. Through the calculation analysis, it is found that the calculated parameter variation trends are reasonable. The higher height difference between the steam generator and the residual heat exchanger and the larger heat transfer area of the residual heat exchanger are favorable to the passive residual heat removal system.},

Previous work demonstrated that in cases of sudden coolant flow reduction or reversal (such as that which would result from a large pipe break near the core inlet), the coolant density reduction around the fuel has a positive reactivity effect that results in a power excursion. Such a transient is inherently self-terminating since the inevitable density reduction in the center flow tube has a very large negative reactivity effect. Nevertheless, a brief power pulse would ensue. In this work, the possibility of mitigating the power pulse with a fast-acting shutdown system was explored. The shutdown system model, consisting of bottom-inserted neutron absorbing blades and realistic estimates of insertion rates and trip conditions, was added to a full-core coupled spatial neutron kinetics and thermal-hydraulics model. It was demonstrated that such a system can effectively mitigate both the peak magnitude of the power excursion and its duration.}",
