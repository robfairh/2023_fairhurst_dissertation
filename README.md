# README by me

Final version: `2023-11-28_Fairhurst-Roberto_Thesis.pdf` which should match the pdf version produced if running `make`.

Template downloaded from: https://grad.illinois.edu/thesis/format

* To compile the file: make
* To clean extra files: make clean-aux
* To remove all generated files: make clean

Some dependencies were missing, and I had to do the following: <br />
sudo apt-get install -y texlive-bibtex-extra <br />
sudo apt install biber

* Some modifications:
  * It seems like the graduate college likes only chapters in the table of contents
  * I don't like it, so I modified `tocdepth` in `uiucthesis2021.cls`, `.dtx`, and `.sty`.
  * from \usepackage[style=ieee]{biblatex} to \usepackage[style=ieee, dashed=false]{biblatex}. Otherwise, ieee style uses a dash to hide the name of authors if consecutive references have the same authors.


# Original README

## uiucthesis class

A LaTeX package for formatting theses in the format required by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

A class file and style file are provided. Both provide identical functionality except that the class file loads the "book" class with the [oneside] option.

## Files

- uiucthesis2021.dtx: Source for uiucthesis.cls, uiucthesis.sty and thesis-ex.tex
- uiucthesis2021.ins: Driver file for uiucthesis.dtx
- uiucthesis2021.pdf: Precompiled PDF file of documentation from .dtx file
- thesis.tex: Example main file
- uiucthesis2021.cls: Pregenerated class file
- uiucthesis2021.sty: Pregenerated style file (for backwards-compatibility)

## Installation

To (re)generate the `.ins`, `.cls`, and `.sty` file (and the documentation), simply compile `uiucthesis2021.dtx` like any other document.
E.g., using `latexmk`,

```bash
latexmk -pdf -synctex=1 uiucthesis2021.dtx
```
## Dependencies

This package uses the `setspace`, `geometry`, `babel`, `titletoc`, and `fancyhdr` packages.
`titlesec` is used for the example chapter heading format in `ruledchapters.sty`.

## Update Notes

- 3.1 (Zachary J Weiner)
  * Format table of contents entries with titletoc, prepend "Chapter" and "Appendix"
  * Place appendices after references, returning to `\mainmatter` so that appendices are still numbered
  * Add copyright and licensing information
- 3.0 (Zachary J Weiner)
  * Significant revision, obsolete options removed and source simplified
- 2.25b (Stephen Mayhew)
  * Removed the Vita Section
  * Added a Makefile
  * Changed all dates from 2009 -> 2014
  * Be careful when updating the date in the first line of uiucthesis2021.dtx! All numbers must be two digits, including month and day.


# Note concerning dependencies

We received the following message concerning dependencies from a student:

To wit, bibtex does not work, you need to use â€œbiber" as a bibliography engine.
Instructions on how to change the engine from bibtex to biber on multiple LaTeX IDE can be found here https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/154751/biblatex-with-biber-configuring-my-editor-to-avoid-undefined-citations
